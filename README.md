## Roadmap

The following outlines the next features that are considered for implementation.
All of those are subject to change based on user feedback, or changes in development resources.

### March 2025 (completed)

During the Encode Culb Hackathon, BTC Gift Cards received a developer grant which also covered development of the following features.

- Implement new design
- Simplify account management
- Automated testing
- Documentation

### Further plans

- Automate sending emails (most likeley needed at some point, currently still manual)
- Add redeem by code (without email verification)
- Lightning integration to deposit/withdraw ckBTC

### Obsolete

- Shortcut to transfer gift card balance to main account
  - Not relevant as there is only one account for both gift cards and deposits.
- Progress indicator for ckBTC minter
  - Minting ckBTC has been removed. Users should use the NNS to convert between ckBTC and Bitcoin.
- Secure account by creating an II (To introduce new users to Internet Identity, which is widely used by apps on the IC)
  - Does not add much value for the app and makes it more confusing for new users. Users can learn about II by getting introduced to the NNS and other dApps on the IC.
